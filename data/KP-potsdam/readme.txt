Indices of Global Geomagnetic Activity
--------------------------------------

Geomagnetic Kp Index

The planetary three-hour-range Kp index was introduced by J. Bartels in 1949
and is derived from the standardized K index (Ks) of 13 magnetic
observatories. It is designed to measure solar particle radiation by its
magnetic effects.

Musical Kp Diagram

The most popular representation of the Kp indices is in form of the Bartels
musical diagram (musical scales).

Geomagnetic ap, Ap, Cp and C9 Indices

The geomagnetic ap, Ap, Cp and C9 indices and the classification of
international Q-days and D-days are derived from the Kp index.

Related Indices

Km is an index similar to Kp, except for the different number and selection
of stations and the method of averaging. The indices am and Am are similar
to ap and Ap. Km, am and Am are evaluated at l'Institut de Physique du Globe
in Paris, France.

Structure of the FTP sites

As a member of the International Service of Geomagnetic Indices, the
GeoForschungsZentrum, Adolf-Schmidt-Observatory in Niemegk supplies
historical and current Kp and derived indices per anonymous FTP.
Two FTP servers with identical structure are available:

     Denmark: ftp://ftp.dmi.min.dk/pub/Data/WDCC1/indices/kp-ap/
     Germany: ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/kp-ap/
     (WWW access: http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/kp-ap/)

Note: FTP sites may refuse connections due to excessive traffic.
      Your mileage may vary with a different FTP program.

The kp-ap/ directory contains

readme.txt (text file)
     A plain text copy of the Geomagnetic Indices WWW page.
music.exe (binary executable file)
     A PC executable program for 386 or higher machines. music.exe reads
     Kp/ap values in WDC format and produces a PostScript file with Bartels
     Kp music diagram. Download music.exe using binary mode! The data file
     ssc.dat is also required to run music.exe.
ssc.dat (text data file)
     List of sudden commencements (ssc), partly preliminary.
tab/ (subdirectory)
     contains the monthly Kp/ap tables in a simple text format readable for
     both humans and computers (*.tab). The file tab_fmt.doc provides a
     format description. The tables distributed by regular mail (PostScript
     format) are also provided in this directory.
wdc/ (subdirectory)
     contains the monthly (respectively yearly) Kp/ap tables and much more
     information in condensed tables (ASCII format). The format is nearly
     identical to the format of Kp/ap tables distributed by the World Data
     Center A for Solar-Terrestrial Physics. The file wdc_fmt.doc provides a
     format description. This format does not contain any information on the
     quiet and most disturbed days as the tables in the tab directory do.
music/ (subdirectory)
     contains the Kp values in the Bartels musical diagram (PostScript
     format), which is very helpful in visualizing the indices.
quietdst/ (subdirectory)
     contains tables of the quietest and most disturbed days for all months
     since Jan 1932. (Values since 1900 also supplied, use with caution.)
kp-freq/ (subdirectory)
     contains tables of frequencies of Kp indices.
ap_monyr.ave (text file)
     A table with monthly and yearly averages of Ap.
