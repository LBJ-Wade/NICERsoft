# NICERsoft
User-contributed analysis tools for the NICER mission. This is separate from the
NICER-team-developed tools that are part of the HEASoft distribution.

This repo is for sharing NICER analysis codes, mostly written in Python, and frequently based on PINT for timing calculations.

Please contribute tools you develop!

USAGE:

To use these scripts add <basedir>/NICERsoft/scripts to your PATH
and add <basedir>/NICERsoft to your PYTHONPATH, where <basedir> is wherever you
cloned NICERsoft.

NOTES:

* Dependencies on PINT are OK

* Executable scripts go in the scripts directory

* Scripts in any language (Python, PERL, bash, tcsh, etc...) are OK to contribute!
