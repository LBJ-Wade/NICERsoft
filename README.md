# NICERsoft
Analysis software for the NICER mission

This repo is for sharing NICER analysis codes, mostly written in Python, and frequently based on PINT for timing calculations.

Please contribute tools you develop!

NOTES:

* Dependencies on PINT are OK

* Need to be able to generate analytic template profiles from photon data

* Need to be able to generate TOAs from a template and photon data, either with
phases already assigned or assigning them using PINT
